# Coding Quiz Challenge

## Description

For this project I made a quiz that asks pretty simple questions about web development as a timer counts down in the back. If the user answers a question wrong than the countdown is reduced by 10. The quiz is over when either the user finishes all 5 questions or the timer hits 0. Then the high score can be saved in the local storage. I built this project so that I could build my DOM manipulation skills and logic while allowing the user to play a fairly boring game. I hope that the user learns a few things about javascript after answering the five questions. It was helpful to me because I learned that next time I really have to try and keep my code in check, it was definitely spaghetti by the time I was done. I also, learned about local storage and prevent defaults.
